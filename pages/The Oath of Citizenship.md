- I swear (or affirm)
  That I will be faithful
  And bear true allegiance
  To His Majesty
  King Charles the Third
  King of [[Canada]] 
  His Heirs and Successors
  And that I will faithfully observe
  The laws of [[Canada]]
  Including the Constitution
  Which recognizes and affirms
  The Aboriginal and treaty rights of
  First Nations, Inuit and MÃ©tis peoples
  And fulfil my duties as a Canadian citizen.
- Interpretation:
	- In [[Canada]], we profess our loyalty to a person who represents all Canadians and not to a document such as a Constitution, a banner such as a flag, or a geopolitical entity such as a country
	- In our constitutional monarchy, these elements are encompassed by the [[Sovereign]]
	- It is a remarkably simple yet powerful principle:
		- Canada is personified by the [[Sovereign]] just as the [[Sovereign]] is personified by Canada
