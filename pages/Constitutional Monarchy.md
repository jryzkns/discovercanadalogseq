- As a constitutional monarchy, Canada's Head of State is a hereditary [[Sovereign]], who reigns in accordance with the Constitution: the rule of law

- His Majesty is a symbol of Canadian sovereignty, a guardian of constitutional freedoms, and a reflection of our history
- The Royal Family's example of lifelong service to the community is an encouragement for citizens to give their best to their country
- As Head of the Commonwealth, the [[Sovereign]] links Canada to 53 other nations that cooperate to advance social, economic, and cultural progress
- There is a clear distinction between the head of state ([[Sovereign]]) and head of government ([[Prime Minister]]), who actually directs the governing of the country
- The three branches of government work together and sometimes in creative tension to help secure the rights and freedom of Canadians
