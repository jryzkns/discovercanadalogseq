- One of the privileges of Canadian citizenship is the right to vote
- You are eligible to vote in a federal election or cast a ballot in a federal referendum if you are
	- a Canadian citizen; and
	- at least 18 years old on voting day; and
	- on the voters' list
- The voters' list used during federal elections and referendums are produced from the [[National Register of Electors]] by a neutral agency of Parliament called [[Elections Canada]]
- Once an election has been called, [[Elections Canada]] mails a [[voter information card]] to each elector whose name is in the [[National Register of Electors]]
- Even if one chooses to not be listed in the [[National Register of Electors]] or do not receive a [[voter information card]] , they can still be added to the voters' list at any time including on election day
- Canadian law secures the right to a secret ballot
	- No one can watch you vote and no one should look at how you voted
	- Disclosing voting choices is entirely voluntary
