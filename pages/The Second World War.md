- The Second World War began in 1939 when Adolf Hitler, the National Socialist (Nazi) dictator of Germany, invaded Poland and conquered much of Europe
- Canada joined with its democratic allies in the fight to defeat tyranny by force of arms
- More than 1 million Canadians and Newfoundlanders (at the time, still a separate British entity) served in the war, out of a population of 11.5 million
	- This was a high proportion and of these, 44,000 were killed
- The Canadians fought bravely and suffered losses in the unsuccessful defense of Hong Kong (1941) from attack by Imperial Japan, and in a failed raid on Nazi-controlled Dieppe on the coast of France (1942)
- The [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] took part in the [[Battle of Britain]] and provided a high proportion of Commonwealth aircrew in bombers and fighter planes over Europe
- Canada contributed more to the Allied air effort than any other Commonwealth country, with over 130,000 Allied air crew trained in Canada under the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan
- The [[Royal Canadian Navy]] saw its finest hour in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]], protecting convoys of merchant shops against German submarines

- Regrettably, the state of war and public opinion in BC led to the forcible relocation of Canadians of Japanese origin by the federal government and the sale of their property without compensation
	- This occurred even though the military and the [[Royal Mounted Canadian Police]] told [[Ottawa]] that they posed little danger to [[Canada]]
	- The Government of Canada apologized in 1988 for wartime wrongs and compensated the victims
